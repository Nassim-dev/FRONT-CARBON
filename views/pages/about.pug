      p.text-small(style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left; margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 90px; line-height: 20px") We all know that gas, oil, cars and fashion industry are responsible for most of the pollution in the world. But did you know that social media can damage our planete same as these. How? l'it us explain. Each gesture made on the web emits a carbon footprint: visiting a website, viewing a video, sending an email: these acts that seem without consequences are not. <br><br> The display of a web page, for example, requires a chain reaction: for the browser to display the page and all of its elements to you, it will make a certain number of requests to a server which has these elements. and will serve them to him in return. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">How we used Twitter ?</span> <br><br> In our case Twitter, the energy used is roughly proportional to the amount of data transferred. We measure the data transferred over the wire when a web page is loaded, and multiply that by the energy usage data that we have. So basicly when you tweet, like or share a post, there is a data transfer which consumes a small amount of energy since social media runs on data centers <br><br>  Each request requires energy to be made, therefore electricity, and this is what generates CO2. The more complex a web page is and requires queries and the use of heavy elements (large images, video content, complex scripts, etc.), the higher its carbon emissions. <br><br> A Harvard researcher studied the average release from a site and he came up with the figure of 20g of CO2 per second. Multiply by the number of Internet users and the time spent on sites per day, you quickly get astronomical numbers. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy source used by Twitter data center </span><br><br> To gauge the energy source, we assume that Twitter use standard grid electricity for the telecoms network and end user, since we have no way to determine otherwise. For the data centre energy use. We estimate the proportion of energy used in the data centres to be approximately 10% by comparing the global data centre energy usage stated in the Nature article to total ICT energy usage in the Andrae and Edler report. Of course, the GWF database is not 100% perfect and also includes data centres that purchase standard grid electricity but offset their emissions. <br><br> <span style="font-weight: bold">How Carbon calculates all this</span> <br><br> Carbon is made up of two parts, on the one hand the data sent by Twitter such as number of followers and number of Tweets which data in relation to the user (a personalized data in real time), on the other hand, the data retrieved from our proxy API who will analyze and processe the raw Twitter data on the backend to send processed data that matters like CO2 emissions and rating or user score all the calculations are done on the backend due to security raisons and for more consistincy. When we put all of this information together, we get a pretty good idea of the emissions associated with an average Twitter user.

    p.text-regular Le Lorem Ipsum est simplement du faux texte employé dans la composition et la mise en page avant impression. Le Lorem Ipsum est le faux texte standard de l'imprimerie depuis les années 1500, quand un imprimeur anonyme assembla ensemble des morceaux de texte pour réaliser un livre spécimen de polices de texte. Il n'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.
